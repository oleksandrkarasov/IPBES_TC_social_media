## IPBES_TC_social_media
This repository contains code scripts used for analysing visions collected from X (Twitter) within the IPBES Transformative Change Assessment (Chapter 2).
Code script 'Collecting tweets.R' is prepared to collect raw X (Twitter) data; 'BERTTopic (tweets).ipynb' and 'Zero-shot model for Twitter visions.ipynb' Jupyter notebooks describe topic modelling classification of the tweets with BERTTopic algorithm, and a zero-shot classification of the tweets to 'nature', 'culture', 'society', and 'greenwashing' categories, respectively. 
File 'df_tweets.csv' contains a random sample of the tweets for testing purposes.
